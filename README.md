# Exotic-Fruit-Recognition
## Summary
Nowadays in supermarkets you see variety of fruits, and also a seperate section for exotic fruits. Many questions pop up in mind as you you glance them. For eg:
  1. What is the name?
  2. Where is it from?
  3. How it tastes and about its texture and so on....
Keeping this in mind a Exotic fruit recognition model is created which takes the image of the fruit and predicts whether it is a exotic fruit or not. To start with 4 types of exotic fruits have been chosen and they are Kaki, Cherimoya, Rambutan and Mangosteen.

## Collecting Data
Data is been collected by downloading the images from Flickr using api's and then labelling them. The images are then pre processed accorcing to the model requirements.
